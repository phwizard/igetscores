= Installing your own iGetScores server instance guide =


 1. Upload all the files on your webserver via FTP ( for example www.mygame.com/hs/*.* )
    Make sure you're uploading to web folder, usually it would be under /public_html/

 2. Edit /inc/config.php - enter your MySQL database access details

 3. Add update_countries.php to cron jobs. For cPanel equipped hostings you would just go to
    Advanced - Cron jobs and then when in standard view, put in something like this (depends
    on your PHP path and of course your high scores server location):

    /usr/local/bin/php -f /home/igetscor/public_html/hs2/update_countries.php

    Make it run every fifteen minutes or so.

 4. Run the igetscor.sql database dump (either via shell or import it using phpMyAdmin).

 5. Edit the database via phpMyAdmin and add a record for your game in 'oauth_server_registry'.
    Make sure 'osr_id' and 'osr_usa_id_ref' have the same values.

 6. Go to 'subgames' table and add subgames (at least one) for your game. 'game_id' should correspond to 'osr_id' in 'oauth_server_registry'.
